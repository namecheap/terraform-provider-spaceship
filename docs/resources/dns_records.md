# spaceship_dns_records (Resource)

Manages the full DNS record set for a Spaceship-managed domain. The Spaceship API updates records as a batch, so Terraform replaces the entire set on each apply.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spaceship_dns_records" "example" {
  domain = "example.com"

  records = [
    {
      type    = "A"
      name    = "@"
      ttl     = 3600
      address = "203.0.113.10"
    },
    {
      type    = "AAAA"
      name    = "@"
      ttl     = 3600
      address = "2001:db8::1"
    },
    {
      type       = "MX"
      name       = "@"
      ttl        = 3600
      exchange   = "mail.example.com"
      preference = 10
    },
    {
      type  = "CNAME"
      name  = "www"
      ttl   = 3600
      cname = "example.com"
    },
    {
      type  = "TXT"
      name  = "@"
      ttl   = 3600
      value = "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) The domain name to manage (for example `example.com`). The domain must already exist in the Spaceship account.
- `records` (Attributes List) DNS records that should be configured for the domain. Each apply replaces the complete set of records. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))

### Optional

- `force` (Boolean) Force Spaceship to apply the DNS update even if conflicts are detected. The Spaceship API requires this flag when overwriting existing records.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier for tf state.

<a id="nestedatt--records"></a>

### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `name` (String) Record host. Use `@` for the zone apex.

Optional:

- `address` (String) IPv4 or IPv6 address for A and AAAA records
- `alias_name` (String) Alias target for ALIAS records.
- `association_data` (String) Association data (hex) for TLSA records.
- `cname` (String) Canonical name for CNAME records.
- `exchange` (String) Mail exchange host for MX records.
- `flag` (Number) Flag for CAA records (0 or 128).
- `matching` (Number) Matching type for TLSA records (0-255).
- `nameserver` (String) Nameserver host for NS records.
- `pointer` (String) Pointer target for PTR records.
- `port` (String) Port for HTTPS, SVCB and TLSA records(accepts `*` or `_NNNN`).
- `port_number` (Number) Port for SRV records (1-65535).
- `preference` (Number) Preference value for MX records (0-65535).
- `priority` (Number) Priority for SRV records (0-65535).
- `protocol` (String) Protocol label for SRV/TLSA records (e.g. `_tcp`).
- `scheme` (String) Scheme for HTTPS/SVCB/TLSA records (for exampel `_https`, `_tcp`)
- `selector` (Number) Selector value for TLSA records (0-255).
- `service` (String) Service label for SRV records (for example `_sip`).
- `svc_params` (String) SvcParams string for HTTPS/SVCB records.
